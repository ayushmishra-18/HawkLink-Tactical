# OVERRIDE EXPLANATION:
# The error `RecordMethodChannelPlatformInterface.startStream` is caused by
# `record_linux` depending on a newer/different interface than what is resolved.
# By overriding `record_linux` to 1.2.0 (which matches record 5.2.0's expectation),
# we ensure the dependency graph is valid.
